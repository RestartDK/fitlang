# Interpreter

The FitLang interpreter is the component that executes FitLang code. It takes the parsed code, typically represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and performs the actions defined by the code. This includes creating and managing client profiles, assigning workout plans, and executing various commands specific to FitLang.

### Interpreter Workflow

1. **AST Traversal**: The interpreter starts by traversing the AST generated by the parser.
2. **Node Execution**: Each node in the AST corresponds to a FitLang construct (e.g., client profile definition, workout plan assignment). The interpreter executes these nodes according to their type and the semantics of FitLang.
3. **Runtime Environment**: The interpreter maintains a runtime environment where it keeps track of all variables and their values, as well as the state of the program.

### Key Functionalities

* **Client Profile Management**: Handles the creation and manipulation of `ClientProfile` objects.
* **Workout Plan Assignment**: Interprets the workout assignment structures and links them to the respective client profiles.
* **Executing Commands**: Processes commands like `showPlans`, outputting the appropriate information to the user.
*

### Example: Handling Client Profiles

When the interpreter encounters a `ClientProfile` node in the AST, it creates a new client profile in its runtime environment.

**Pseudo-Code for Client Profile Handling**:

```c
if (node.type == ClientProfileNode) {
    ClientProfile profile = createNewClientProfile(node.name);
    runtimeEnvironment.addProfile(profile);
}
```



### Example: Executing Workout Plans

For workout plan assignments, the interpreter parses the plan details and associates them with the specified client.

**Pseudo-Code for Workout Plan Assignment**:

```c
if (node.type == WorkoutPlanAssignmentNode) {
    ClientProfile profile = runtimeEnvironment.getProfile(node.clientName);
    WorkoutPlan plan = parseWorkoutPlan(node.planDetails);
    profile.assignPlan(plan);
}
```



### Error Handling

* The interpreter includes error handling mechanisms to deal with runtime errors, such as referencing undefined variables or attempting invalid operations.
* When an error is encountered, the interpreter provides clear error messages, helping the user understand and rectify the issue.
